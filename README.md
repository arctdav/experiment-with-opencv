# experiment-with-opencv

Following tutorial on https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-object-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/

Tried to train for Tim Horton's logo cascade, but it did not work.

Used cascade files from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades for face and eye detection
